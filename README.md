# What is this?
The Six degrees of separation is the idea that all people are six, or fewer, social connections away from each other. As a result, a chain of "a friend of a friend" statements can be made to connect any two people in a maximum of six steps.

# In this project:
Base on the concept of Six Degrees of seperation, the "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" implies the shortest path between an arbitrary actor and the prolific actor Kevin Bacon.
